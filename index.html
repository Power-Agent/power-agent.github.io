            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Power Agent is an open-source community dedicated to accelerating the development of LLM-powered Tools and Agentic AI in the power systems domain. We aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI and the real-world needs of system operators, electric utilities, and researchers, by creating a shared ecosystem of protocols, models, and workflows tailored for power applications.</p>

            <p>We believe the future of agentic AI in power domain will be driven by the combined development and coordination of three key components â€” Foundation Models (FM), Model Context Protocol (MCP), and Workflows (WF).</p>

            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>The rapid rise of LLMs and agentic frameworks has opened new frontiers in intelligent software. Inspired by the success of open-source initiatives in LLMs (like DeepSeek, LlaMA) and agentic control protocols (especially Anthropic's MCP community), we believe it's time to bring the same spirit of innovation and openness to the power systems domain.</p>

            <p>Our vision is Toward Power Grids General Intelligence via open-source collaboration. We are building a comprehensive ecosystem with three interconnected layers:</p>

            <h2>Community</h2>
            <p>Like the best open-source software, Power Agent is built by and for the community. GitHub was chosen as the home of this initiative to enable transparent, global collaboration.</p>
            <p>Curated by the Power and AI Initiative (PAI) at Harvard SEAS, all contributions are reviewed to ensure they are relevant and open-source, utility, and integrity. We invite researchers, engineers, and developers across disciplines to take part in shaping this ecosystem.</p>

            <div class="vision">
                <h3>ðŸ”“ Simple and Unrestricted Access</h3>
                <p>To keep Power Agent accessible with minimal effort, all current benchmarks are maintained and tested using Cursor, one of the most popular agentic coding IDEs. In the interest of open collaboration and replicable experiments, all Power Grid Lib benchmarks are distributed under the MIT license. This means anyone can freely copy, redistribute, and modify these benchmarks.</p>
                <p>While not required, we appreciate credit or acknowledgment of the original creators when reusing or building upon these resources.</p>
