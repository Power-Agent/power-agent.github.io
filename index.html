            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Power Agent is an open-source community dedicated to accelerating the development of LLM-powered tools and agentic workflows in the power systems domain. We aim to bridge the gap between cutting-edge AI and the real-world needs of energy professionals, researchers, and operatorsâ€”by creating a shared ecosystem of protocols, models, and workflows tailored for power applications.</p>

                    <h3>PowerMCP</h3>

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>The rapid rise of LLMs and agentic frameworks has opened new frontiers in intelligent software. Inspired by the success of open-source initiatives in LLMs (such as DeepSeek, LLaMA) and multi-agent control protocols (like Anthropic's Claude and Smithery), we believe it's time to bring the same spirit of innovation and openness to the power systems domain.</p>
            
            <div class="vision">
                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>The future of agentic AI will be driven by the combined development and coordination of three key components â€” Foundation Models (FM), Model Control Protocols (MCP), and Workflows (WF).</p>
                <p>These three pillars form the backbone of intelligent, flexible, and domain-aware agent systems. Power Agent brings them together under one collaborative umbrella, enabling AI to interact meaningfully with the unique tools, data, and logic of power systems.</p>
                <p>By focusing on domain-specific integrationâ€”from simulation platforms to real-time optimizationâ€”Power Agent seeks to unlock new possibilities for automation, intelligence, and human-AI collaboration in the grid of the future.</p>

        <section id="community">
            <h2>Community Curated</h2>
            <p>Like the best open-source software, Power Agent is built by and for the community. GitHub was chosen as the home of this initiative to enable transparent, global collaboration.</p>
            <p>Curated by the Power and AI Initiative (PAI) at Harvard University, all contributions are reviewed to ensure they meet the highest standards of relevance, utility, and integrity. We invite researchers, engineers, and developers across disciplines to take part in shaping this ecosystem.</p>

            <h2>ðŸ”“ Simple and Unrestricted Access</h2>
            <p>To keep Power Agent accessible with minimal effort, all current benchmarks are maintained and tested using Cursor, one of the most popular agentic coding IDEs. In the interest of open collaboration and replicable experiments, all Power Grid Lib benchmarks are distributed under the MIT license. This means anyone can freely copy, redistribute, and modify these benchmarks.</p>
            <p>While not required, we appreciate credit or acknowledgment of the original creators when reusing or building upon these resources.</p>
